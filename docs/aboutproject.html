        This is a virtual time capsule — a quiet rebellion against forgetting. Here, your Image and Sound become part of humanity’s collective digital history, preserved in the electronic "Voyager". 
        It’s our golden record to the centuries ahead.

  <h2>About This Project</h2>
  <p>
The internet changes faster than memory itself, but this wall will stay.
It’s meant to be a time capsule — a digital monument that might outlive us all.
Perhaps, centuries from now, someone will dig through the ruins of the web,
like digital archaeologists, and stumble upon this place.
They’ll find Your Image, Your Message, Your Sound —
a heartbeat from another age,
a whisper from our present to their distant tomorrow.
  </p>
  <p>
When NASA launched the Voyager probes,
they carried a golden record — voices, music, greetings in fifty-five languages —
a message to whoever might find it among the stars.
This wall is our version of that record.
Only this time, the message isn’t traveling through space —
it’s drifting through the endless universe of the internet.
  </p>
  <p>
I want this wall to be honest — a transparent mirror of who we truly are.
Not a museum of perfection, but real — messy, brilliant, human.
A living archive of our collective noise and beauty.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every slot on this wall is a small act of defiance against forgetting.
A way to say I was here. We were here.
A chance to be remembered,
not just by algorithms or history books —
but by the curious souls of the future who come looking for us.

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
          The canvas is fixed at <strong>1000×1000</strong> pixels. Each slot is
          <strong>10×10</strong>, so there are 100×100 slots in total. You choose
          any free area, send your image (sized to the exact slot area), a link, an alt text and a sound.
          I review and publish it on the live board.
        </p>
        <ul>

          <li>A short alt label (what people see when hover over your image)</li>
          <li>Sound to play when hovered over your picture</li>
          <li>Glow and Sparks animations are attention-grabbing elements, thus cost extra</li>
